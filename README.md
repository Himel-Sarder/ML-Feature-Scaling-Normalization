Min-Max Scaling: A technique to scale features to a defined range, usually between 0 and 1. This helps to normalize the feature set and bring all values into a comparable scale.

The repository contains a link to a comprehensive notebook on Kaggle that demonstrates the application of Min-Max Scaling using a practical example.
